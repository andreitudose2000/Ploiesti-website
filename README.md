# Ploiesti-website
Website made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js about my home city, Ploiesti. Has rather interesting features.

My plan was to learn the basics of web skills and build the site as much as I can without the usage of easy-to-use frameworks and libraries, except for backend, where I used Node.js (Express.js). Frontend made using plain HTML and CSS (also flexbox).
